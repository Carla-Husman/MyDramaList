This repository contains the source code for MyDramaList, a Single Page Application that showcases various web development elements and technologies. On this site there will be ideas about the universe of Korean series. Please note that this project was developed as an exploration of different concepts and may not adhere to professional standards.

## Technologies 

- CSS
- HTML
- JavaScript
- AJAX
- Python
- IndexedDB

## Features
The application includes the following pages and features:

- **About Page**: Provides information about the top Korean dramas and series or showcases another website.
- **Registration Page**: Allows users to create an account.
- **Trailers Page**: Displays trailers of TV series using Flexbox to present them in an album-like layout.

Throughout the development of this application, the following concepts were explored and implemented:

- _Promises_ for asynchronous operations.
- _Web Workers_ for background tasks.
- _Prototypes_ and _classes_ for JavaScript object-oriented programming.
- Asynchronous communication with the server using _AJAX_.
- Python _server_ implementation supporting _multi-client_ functionality.

This application was developed as a **_learning project_** and may not reflect best practices or professional standards.
